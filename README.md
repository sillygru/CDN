# Brawlify CDN (cdn.brawlify.com)
A public CDN with [Brawl Stars](https://supercell.com/en/games/brawlstars/) assets extracted from the game or taken from the [Official Fan Kit](https://fankit.supercell.com/).

Any file in this repository is available on [cdn.brawlify.com](https://cdn.brawlify.com/) via [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/) using [Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) cached around the world. There is no traffic limit and no IP blocking. You can link directly, download, or fetch programmatically.

# Usage
This CDN is meant to be linked to programmatically with IDs taken from [in-game files](https://api.brawlify.com/game), for example [player_thumbnails](https://api.brawlify.com/game/csv_logic/player_thumbnails). For random assets, check the [official Fankit](https://fankit.supercell.com/).

It works best with [the official Brawl Stars API](https://developer.brawlstars.com/) and [BrawlAPI](https://brawlapi.com/), which both return the IDs needed to link to this CDN.

# Collaboration and Standards
This repository is open to collaboration. Fixes, additions and updates can be suggested anytime, but all contributed assets **must be compressed** and follow the size standards for the folder they belong to.

Suggesting new standards for file sizes should only be done if there’s a wide need for the asset and no similar standard already exists. Each folder’s `README.md` has more details on its specific standards.

## Compression
Every asset in this repository is compressed using lossy PNG palette reduction ([pngquant](https://pngquant.org/)) to minimize file size while preserving visual quality. All files are 8-bit palette PNGs. Any new assets must be compressed before being added.

[Cloudflare’s Image Optimization](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/polish/) *([Lossy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/polish/compression/#lossy) and [WebP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/polish/compression/#webp))* is also enabled on this CDN, so browsers may receive an even further optimized image in a different format automatically.
